# swingEditor

A pane on the library workbench (see `docs/editorPage.md`) for editing
a swing composite — a list of factors, each with an atom (id / classic
/ pocket / lilt / shuffle / tilt), a shift in QN, and a period. Owned
by editorPage; opened via the `editSwing` command or the tracker's
swing `edit` button, drawn by editorRender.

## State authority

The composite lives in cm (`cm:get('swings')[name]`). The editor
caches nothing about it — every frame, `swingRead()` fetches fresh.
This is the simplest correctness story when the composite can change
from outside (other commands, undo, replay). The editor's own state
is only window chrome and gesture-transient: name, snapshot for
Reset, rpb, Wild flag, last-known size.

## Single-path writes

Every primitive (patch, add, remove, move, slider drag, atom swap,
period change, Reset) routes through `swingWrite`. `swingWrite`
short-circuits on equality and then fires `tv:setSwingComposite`;
cm's resulting `configChanged` broadcast drives `tm:markSwingStale`
on the affected channels, and the next `tm:rebuild`'s step 4.7
reseats raw from each event's ppqL under the new composite. Because
`swingWrite` reads the stored composite as the "old" side of the
delta, per-frame slider-drag calls chain into a correct sequence of
old→new transformations as the slider moves.

## Snapshot

Captured at `open()` from the cm composite. Never mutated. Reset
writes a `deepClone` of it through `swingWrite`. The dirty check
compares the live composite to the snapshot via `compositesEqual`,
which equates `{1,2}` and `{2,4}` — equality is on the QN value, not
the literal table.

## Caps and Wild

Each atom has a mathematical |shift| max past which the swing shape
loses monotonicity (`atomMeta.range`). The editor calls this max
`hard` (in QN: `T_tile · range`). For everyday use it imposes a
soft cap, `min(SWING_SOFT_QN, hard)`, so musically excessive shifts
take a deliberate Wild click to unlock. `cap == 0` (the identity
atom) freezes the slider altogether. Shift is atom-independent QN,
so atom swap preserves it and only re-clamps.

## Tile-QN combo

The user-period of a factor is what gets stored. The atom-combo,
however, speaks tile-QN (= user-period × pulsesPerCycle), because
atoms with `pulsesPerCycle = 2` (pocket, lilt) have a longer real
repeat than their user-period. Surfacing tile-QN in the dropdown
matches what the user perceives. `periodOverPPC` divides on write
to keep storage in user-period.

## Grid model

The preview strip shows one period of swing. Cells are unswung
subdivisions (`rpb` per QN); dots land at the swung image of each
subdivision. Cells provide the rhythmic frame; dots show where the
swing actually puts the onsets — the visual contrast is the point.

`shadeMeter` paints bar/beat backgrounds. The composite preview uses
it (the composite period is rounded up to a whole number of bars so
the meter actually means something); per-factor previews leave it
off because their period rarely aligns to bars and the shading would
lie.

Three dot sizes — bar/midBar > beat > offbeat — let the meter read
at a glance. `midBar` is treated as a beat for shading but as a bar
for dot sizing; the asymmetry is deliberate.

## Library tiers & seeding

Swings resolve across three cm tiers, plus a synthetic floor:

- **defaults** — the built-in preset catalogue (`classic-*`, `delay-*`)
  and `identity`, the unstored, undeletable floor (a bare `{}` ≡ no swing).
- **global** — the user's personal library. Lazily seeded from the
  catalogue (minus `identity`) the first time it is *read* — by the
  editor's tree palette or a tracker picker (`cm:seedGlobalFromDefault`).
  No startup seeding, no flag; an empty global library is the only signal.
- **project** — every swing the project actually references. A project
  is self-contained: realisation resolves names here (plus the identity
  floor) and never leans on the global library or the catalogue.

Project self-containment is held by **copy-on-assign**: picking a swing
for a take or channel (`setSwingSlot` / `setColSwingSlot` → `localizeSwing`)
copies its composite into the project tier if absent, before writing the
name into the take map. `identity` is never localized. `temperEditor`
mirrors this for tempers (`pickTemper`, with `12EDO` as the floor).
